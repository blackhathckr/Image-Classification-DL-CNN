# Image-Classification-DL-CNN
Image Classification implementation using Deep Learning ( Tensorflow , Keras ) , Computer Vision ( openCV ) and Neural Network ( CNN ) .
Create two folders -> 'Train' and 'Test' with the images for training and testing . 
Execute the script 'image_classifier.py' to train , build and create the Deep Learning Model . Use the 'classify_image.py' script to make predictions .
